# 🐍 Python Practice Journal - Day 6, 16, June, 2025

## Study Summary

- 🎥 Watched: froom 2 hours 30 miutes to 3 hours FreeCodeCamp Python Tutorial (Beginner)
- ⏳ Practice Time: ~3 hours
- 🔄 For every topic I watched, I created at least 3 more practice codes myself to build stronger understanding.

## Topics Practiced

- ✅ If-Else Statements with fruits & dry fruits.
- ✅ Logical Operators (and/or/not).
- ✅ Function Definitions:
  - raise_to_power()
  - pizza_slices()
  - translate()
- ✅ 2D Lists & Nested Loops:
  - number_grid, pizza_toppings, animal_zoo, multiplication_table.
- ✅ While Loops (Guessing Game).
- ✅ Fun Translators:
  - G Translator (vowels to 'g')
  - Emoji Translator
  - Animal Translator (vowels to 🐶)
  - Reverse Translator

## Challenges Faced
1. **Typos & Variable Naming**
    - Small spelling errors (`ttranslation` vs `translation`)
2. **Indentation Errors**
    - Forgot proper indentation after `if`, `for`, `def`.
3. **Missing Colons `:`**
    - Forgot colon `:` after control structures.
4. **Function Call & Parenthesis Mistakes**
    - Closed `input()` parenthesis early inside function call.
5. **Logical Thinking While Typing**
    - Confusion between variable names while practicing.

## How I Overcame Challenges
- Carefully read error messages.
- Slowed down typing and read each line before running.
- Repeated small practice codes many times.
- Actively spotted mistakes, debugged & corrected.

## Motivation & Mindset
> Every expert was once a beginner.  
> Every bug is my teacher.  
> Each small fix makes me better and more confident!  
> I am building my coding brain one line, one bug, and one loop at a time.
> Day by day everyday I am getting better better and better

## ✅ Next Steps
- More practice on functions & nested loops.
- Build more fun translators.
- Create small mini-projects.
- Start organizing all code properly in my GitHub repo.
