# 🐍 Practiced Day 11 – 21 June 2025

## ✅ What I Did Today
- Completed watching and practicing FreeCodeCamp video for beginner
- Practiced Python class inheritance
- Created `Rabbit` class with `jump()` and `eat()` methods
- Explored interpreter behavior and error stopping
- Learned how `try-except` keeps the program running
- Worked on real examples: student grading, vehicles, bunny behavior


## ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
- Managing time with kids while practicing
- Forgetting to log some of the completed code properly
- Slight confusion with class re-definitions (student class used twice with different roles)


## 💡 What Motivated Me
- Seeing how much I’ve learned in just 11 days!   
- My own growing confidence — I’m writing full programs now!
- Day by day everyday I am getting better better and better


## 🎯 Goal for Tomorrow (Day 12)
- Practice file handling (read/write/append)
- Learn about `os` module or `random` module
- Try using functions inside classes (like methods calling other methods)
- Stay consistent and practice even if it’s a busy day 💪
