# 🐍 Python Practice - 19 June 2025, Day 9

## 📚 Video Reference
I watched the [FreeCodeCamp Python for Beginners] video:

- **Topic**: Building a Multiple Choice Quiz
- **Time Watched**: 3:57:00 to 4:08:00 (approx. 11 minutes)

## ⏰ Practice Time
🕒 I practiced for about **2 hours** today.

## ✅ Topics Covered

1. **How to build a multiple choice quiz**
2. Created:
   - A `Question` class
   - A question list with prompts and answers
   - A `run_quiz()` function to run the quiz
3. Added:
   - Player name input
   - Personalized score messages

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to design a quiz using **classes and objects**
- How to store multiple questions in a list
- How to accept and check user answers using `input()`
- How to use conditions (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to display messages
- How to use **indentation properly** (still a learning curve!)

## ❓ Challenges I Faced

- Got confused between `question_prompt` and `question_prompts` spelling
- Forgot to **un-indent the function call**, which caused recursion
- Struggled with how many **tabs/spaces** to use before certain lines

## 🛠️ How I Overcame Them

- Read the error messages carefully
- Compared with working examples from yesterday’s code
- Practiced fixing indentation until I saw clean output
- 
## 💪 My Motivation

Even though I felt confused with indentation again, I **didn't give up**!  
When I saw the quiz running properly with correct messages, I felt so proud.  
**Every bug is a step forward** in my learning!
Day by day everyday I am getting better, better and better!

## 🎯 What I’ll Do Tomorrow

- Try saving quiz scores to a file
- Add a feature to randomize questions
- Explore creating categories (Math, Animals, Colors)
