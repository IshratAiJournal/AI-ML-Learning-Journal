## Day 12,13 Date 22nd June & 23rd June 2025

## ðŸ“š Learning Journey

- ðŸ“† Started FreeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python Certification on **June 22, 2025**
- âœ… Completed the first 11 steps of the **Caesar Cipher Project**
- ðŸ§© Currently stuck (and still smiling ðŸ˜…) at **Step 70** â€” transforming Caesar into VigenÃ¨re!
- ðŸ’¡ Learning through failure, curiosity, and tons of trial & error.

- ## ðŸ’« Motivation

Even when the code doesnâ€™t run and the errors stack up, I remind myself:
> *"The expert in anything was once a beginner."*

Iâ€™m not here to be perfect â€” Iâ€™m here to **persist**. Every error teaches me something new,
and every small win builds the momentum. I'm learning not just Python, but **resilience**. ðŸš€
Day by day everyday I am getting better better and better!


## ðŸŒ± What's Next?
- Solve Step 70, no matter what ðŸ˜¤
- Finish my first certification
- Share what I learn, help others, and grow my repo collection
