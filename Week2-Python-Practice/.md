# 🐍 Python Practice - 18 June 2025

I watched the [FreeCodeCamp Python for Beginners] video from: **3:30:00 to 3:57:00**

## ⏰ Practice Time
I practiced Python for around **3 hours** today.

## ✅ Topics Covered

1. **Modules and pip**
2. **Classes and Objects**
3. **Created my first independent project using a class!**

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to import and use modules like `math`, `random`, and `pandas`
- How to install packages using `!pip install` in Google Colab
- How to create and use classes and objects in Python
- How `__init__()` helps in storing data inside an object
- How methods work inside a class
- Importance of indentation in Python (very important!)
- How to write and organize code properly

## ❓ Challenges I Faced

- I was confused about **where to write object creation** in class-based code  
- My **indentation** was often wrong — I put code inside a method by mistake  
- Small typos like `randit` instead of `randint`, `to_CSV` instead of `to_csv`

## 🛠️ How I Overcame Them
- Learned how to carefully check indentation
- Practiced multiple times until it finally worked
- Understood the difference between **inside the class** vs **outside the class**

## 💪 My Motivation

🌟 When my bunny code finally worked, I was so proud!  
I really felt like a **real Python programmer**.  
I didn’t give up, even when the same mistake happened again and again.  
Now I believe — **I can learn anything if I keep trying**.

## 🎯 What I’ll Do Tomorrow

- Practice more with **classes and objects**
- Try some **real-world mini projects** (like Dog, Robot, Student, Game Score)
- Start learning **lists and loops inside classes**
