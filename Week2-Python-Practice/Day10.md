# Day 10: Practicing Object Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¥ Watched
- FreeCodeCamp Beginner Python Video
- Topic: Object Functions (Methods in Classes)

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- What are object functions (methods)
- How to define and call them using `self`
- Practiced with fun examples: Dog, Rabbit, and Student classes

## ðŸ’ª What I Practiced
- Defined `bark()`, `sit()`, `roll_over()` for Dog
- Made Rabbit eat and jump
- Gave feedback based on grades using Student class

## ðŸ˜… Challenges
- I accidentally called a method that didnâ€™t exist (`roll_over`) â€” fixed it by defining the method
- Still working on recognizing indentation levels

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation
Even a small step is still progress. Showing up matters. My thinking is becoming more like a coder day by day.
Day by day everyday I am getting better, better and better.
## ðŸ“… Time Spent
- Watched video: ~10 minutes
- Practiced: ~15â€“20 minutes

## ðŸ”œ What's Next
- Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll either continue the video or begin the FreeCodeCamp certificate projects!
