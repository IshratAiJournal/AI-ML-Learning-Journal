ðŸ§  Day 14 â€“ 25 June 2025
âœ… Achievements Today
ðŸŽ‰ Completed Project 1: VigenÃ¨re Cipher (FreeCodeCamp - Scientific Computing with Python Certification)

Faced real challenges around Step 70, but didnâ€™t give up. Debugged line by line and finally cracked it!

Learnt about encryption, decryption, default parameters, .isalpha(), f-strings, and good coding practices.

ðŸš€ Started Project 2: Arithmetic Formatter

Feeling more confident after completing the first project.

Looking forward to formatting problems cleanly with proper alignment and spacing.

ðŸ’ª Motivation
Every challenge is a chance to grow. What once felt impossible is now complete â€” step 70 was a roadblock, but now itâ€™s a badge of honor! 
I'm learning for my children, for my future, and for the joy of solving problems one line at a time.
Day by day everyday I am getting better better and better!

ðŸŒ± Whatâ€™s Next?
Continue working through Project 2.

Understand how to manage spacing, alignment, and error-checking in formatted outputs.

Share more of my learning journey and commit consistently to GitHub.
