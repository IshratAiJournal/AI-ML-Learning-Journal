# Day 4: June 15, 2025
**Topic Covered**:
Tuples (immutable,indexed)
Defining Functions in Python
Return Statements
If / Else Conditons

**Key Points**:
Tuples use `()` are immutable (used for data that is never going to change
Functions use `def`, and `return` sends back a result
`if`, `elif`, and `else` let us make decisions

**What I practiced**
Created a function to greet a user
Used return statement to do simple math
Wrote if-else to check age and name

**Struggled With**
Today I struggled with variable names, spaces, and indentation in Python if-else.
**Plan for Newt Time**
Learn and practice loops (for, while)
**Motivation**
Day by day everyday I am getting better better and better!
