# 🚀 Day 25 — Python Learning Log  
🗓️ Date: 5 July 2025  
📚 Course: Coursera *Programming for Everybody* — **Module 6 (Functions) — Part 1**

## ✅ What I Did Today
- Watched **two Module 6 videos**  
  1. *Using Functions*  
  2. *Building Functions*
- Completed the **Module 6 Quiz (Questions 1 – 10)** with a perfect **100 %** 🎉
- Practised function concepts by answering:
  - `def` keyword usage
  - Indentation rules for ending a function block
  - Difference between *built‑in* and *user‑defined* functions
  - Arguments vs. parameters
- Updated my local notes and pushed yesterday’s Day 24 files to GitHub.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
| Issue | How I Overcame It |
|-------|-------------------|
| Remembering exact quiz wording (e.g., indentation rules) | Re‑watched key video segments and took concise notes. |
| Confusing built‑in vs user‑defined functions | Reviewed the official Python docs and wrote tiny test snippets. |

## 💡 Key Concepts Learned
- Writing a function with **`def`, parameters, colon, indentation**.
- Using **`return`** to send a value back to the caller.
- Importance of **de‑indentation** to signal the end of a code block.
- Built‑in functions (`input`, `max`, etc.) vs. functions I create.

## Motivation
Day by day every day I am being invincible!


## 🧭 Next Steps (Day 26 Plan)
- Finish the *4.6 computepay* assignment with a custom function.
- Watch the *Guido van Rossum* interview for extra inspiration.
- Wrap up **Module 6** and prepare for **Module 7 (Loops)**.
