🎉 FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python – Progress Update

📅 Date Range: 27–29 June 2025🏁 Certification Completed: Scientific Computing with Python (FreeCodeCamp)

✅ Projects Completed:

Budget App

Created a class-based budget manager with methods for deposit, withdraw, transfer, and balance.

Implemented __str__ for custom formatting.

Built a spend chart showing percentage breakdowns by category.

✅ Completed with all test cases passing after debugging spacing issues.

Probability Calculator

Created a Hat class to simulate random draws from a collection of balls.

Implemented an experiment function to calculate the probability of drawing expected outcomes.

✅ Fixed issues with draw logic and passed all tests.

💪 Challenges Faced:

Spacing alignment issues in create_spend_chart() that passed in Google Colab but failed in FCC.

Debugging vertical category name formatting that was extremely sensitive to whitespaces.

Fixed logical error in draw() when requested more balls than available.

Final steps for certification required completing the honesty policy and updating public profile info on FCC.

🌟 Motivation:

Despite being a weekend, I kept learning because I’m genuinely loving this journey. I’m a beginner, a mother, and learning to code daily from scratch.
I stayed committed even late at night — because this is my dream! Day by day every day I am getter better, better and better!

📌 What’s Next:

Add this certificate and all project folders to my GitHub.

Begin learning the next stack: either Web Development, Data Science, or AI/Machine Learning.

Start building real-world projects and exploring freelancing platforms.
