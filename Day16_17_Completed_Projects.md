### ✅ Day 16-17 – 26th-27th June 2025

**✔️ Completed Project 3: `Build a Time Calculator` (26th June)**
After spending an extra day to deeply understand Project 2, I successfully typed and completed **Project 3**! This was a huge confidence boost 💪🎉

**💡 Challenges Faced:**

* I initially struggled with splitting time strings and converting between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
* Made several syntax errors (like `idx()` instead of `index()`, or wrong variable names), but I fixed each one by patiently debugging.
* Learning how to handle optional parameters and days of the week was especially eye-opening!

**💬 Motivation:**
Typing the entire code manually helped me understand each line better. Small wins like fixing typos and passing test cases gave me a real sense of progress! 🚀
Day by day every day I am getting better, better and better!

**🔜 What’s Next?**
I’ve officially started **Project 4: Build a Budget App** on 27th June. I'm excited because it seems more complex and practical.
My goal is to break it into small parts, learn object-oriented concepts, and maybe even visualize the budget!

**🌟 Personal Note:**
I’m proud of not rushing and allowing myself to make mistakes and learn from them. With each project, I feel more confident as a Python programmer.
