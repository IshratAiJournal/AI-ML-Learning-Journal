# 🚀 Day 24 — Python Learning Log  
🗓️ Date: 4 July 2025  
📚 Module: 5 (Conditional Execution) — **Completed**

## ✅ What I Did Today

Today was a **milestone day** in my Python learning journey! Here's what I accomplished:

- ✅ Completed **Module 5** of the Coursera "Programming for Everybody" course by the University of Michigan.
- ✅ Learned how to:
  - Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` for conditional logic
  - Handle numeric input with `input()` and `float()`
  - Add proper error handling using `try/except`
- ✅ Successfully wrote and tested two programs:
  - A **Gross Pay Calculator** with overtime logic
  - A **Grading Program** to assign letter grades (A–F) based on score input
- ✅ Practiced printing **exact output** expected by autograders
- ✅ Saved Python files using **Brackets** and learned how to structure project folders properly
- ✅ Created `.md` and `.py` files for GitHub and prepared to push changes

🎉 **Module 5 is done, and grades updated on the server!**

## ⚠️ Challenges I Faced

- ❌ **Accidentally typed `flote()` instead of `float()`**, which caused a runtime error  
- 🤔 Got a `NameError` saying `'score_input' not defined` because I had placed the `input()` statement after the `try:` block
- ❗ Struggled with autograder feedback — learned that **exact capitalization and punctuation** in `print()` matters (e.g., `Pay:` vs `pay`)
- ⌨️ Didn't know how to go to a new line in ChatGPT on laptop — **learned `Shift + Enter`**
- 💾 Figured out how to open the correct Python file every time using **Brackets + organized folder structure**
- ⏳ Managed everything while juggling mom duties — picking up kids and fitting coding between routines!

## 💡 Motivation

> *"One module a day keeps self-doubt away."*

I’m learning not just how to code, but how to problem-solve, how to Google smartly, how to troubleshoot — and that’s real growth. Every bug fixed is a confidence boost.  
Also, knowing my children are watching makes me want to push further and never give up. Day by day every day I am becoming invincible! 💖👩‍👧‍👦


## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- Conditionals: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Type conversion: `float()`
- Error handling: `try/except`
- Input validation and range checking
- Printing expected output formats


## 🔜 What's Next (Day 25 Plan)

- Start **Module 6**: Functions in Python
- Learn to:
  - Define reusable functions with `def`
  - Pass parameters and return values
  - Understand local vs global scope
- Practice writing 2–3 custom functions with input/output
- Push code and daily log to GitHub

## 💬 Reflection

Today’s errors weren’t setbacks — they were stepping stones.  
I now see bugs as friends who teach me deeper things than a successful run ever could.  
The sense of clarity and completion at the end of the day is unbeatable
