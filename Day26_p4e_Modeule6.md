# 🚀 Day 26 — Python Learning Log  
🗓️ Date: 6 July 2025  
📚 Course: Coursera *Programming for Everybody* — **Module 6 (Functions) — Completed**

## ✅ What I Did Today
- **Completed Module 6** and submitted the *4.6 computepay* assignment:  
  - Wrote `computepay(hours, rate)` with overtime logic.  
  - Tested → `Pay 498.75` for 45 h @ ₹10.5/h.  
  - Autograder accepted on the **first attempt**! 🌟
- Listened to *“Video Interview: Guido van Rossum — The Early Years of Python”*.  
  - Learned why readability and indentation are core to Python’s philosophy.
- Fixed tiny typos (`Returen` → `Return`) and prompt‑label mismatches.
- Reflected on the importance of **patience and precision** in coding.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Typo in docstring (`Returen`) | Careful re‑reading before running tests. |
| Capitalisation / exact prompt text | Matched sample output exactly for the autograder. |
| Remembering to **return `pay`** (not `hours`) | Stepped through the code logically and printed interim values. |

## 💡 Highlights & Takeaways
- Functions enable **code reuse** and cleaner structure.
- Python’s strict indentation is *by design* for readability.
- Small wins (+ early‑morning focus time) compound into major progress.

## Movtivation
Day by day every day I am becoming INVICIBLE!

## 🔜 What’s Next
- **Module 7 — Loops**: dive into `while` and `for`.
- Start a small practice project combining **functions + loops** (e.g., quiz scorer).
- Keep refining GitHub workflow (branching, commits, README badges).
